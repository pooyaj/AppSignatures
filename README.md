AppSignatures
=============
Demo: [http://pooya.jaferian.com/appsignatures]

This is a quick visualization of application signatures database. I used the Fortinet application dataset, and visualized so that security admins can quickly identify a particular application, or make sense of the overall status of the applications in one particular category. I included the following to make the database more usable: 
- Two levels of abstraction 
- Multiple views 
- Data filtering 

On the technical side, the prototype is developed using AngularJS, and d3.js. This is a nice example of how you can combine Angular and d3 to build chart directives, and reuse the directives in your code.
